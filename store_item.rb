#Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:
#You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.
#Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.
#Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. #JavaScript syntax {a: 123}).
